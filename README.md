# ConvNet
Convolution Neural Network Implementation

This is an incomplete implementation, and is in active progress.

Full C++ implementation is planned (as high performance as I dare to attempt), with customisability to allow the user to define and train any sort of CNN.
I hope to be finished with the basic CNN learning algorithm within the next couple of weeks, thereafter I will publish
a complete documentation of the library so far.

Also, any models trained will naturally have a serialisation API to allow reuse of a trained model.

## Future Ideas
- GPU usage facilities (probably OpenCL) to help along performance.
